All these achievements are unique and interesting in their own way. Some of them you will get as you progress through the levels, and for some you will have to do level research, or hone your skills to complete them.

## Coins: 

In addition to achievements, here is a player reward system - Coins, which you can get by completing and claim achievements. The amount of reward varies depending on the difficulty of the achievement.

You can use your Coins to buy unlockable items in supported mods.

## Discord RPC:

Let everyone know how many achievements you have completed and how many Coins you have now.

The Achievements menu in RPC will show the total value of completed / all achievements, and the current value of Coins. In addition, it will show which achievement you have currently selected in the menu, and will show its stars and completion status.

During the main gameplay, when completing an achievement, the RPC will show which achievement you have completed and how many stars it has.
